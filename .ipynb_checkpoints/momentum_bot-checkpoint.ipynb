    "In this strategy the bot trades based off current momentum trends in the market. It buys when a stock has positive momentum over some perioud of time and then sells when that momentum turns negative. This strategy has performed well over recent years [SOURCE] and has some key advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "- Trend Following: Momentum strategies capitalize on established trends, potentially leading to higher returns during bull markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavioral Finance: They exploit behavioral biases, such as the tendency for investors to overreact to news or trends, allowing for profits from mispriced assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplicity: Momentum strategies can be relatively straightforward to implement, using clear signals based on price movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical Success: Many studies suggest that momentum strategies have historically outperformed the market over certain time frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diversification: Momentum can be applied across various asset classes (stocks, commodities, currencies), offering diversification benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reversals: Momentum can lead to significant losses if a trend reverses unexpectedly, as past performance does not guarantee future results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market Volatility: During volatile or sideways markets, momentum strategies may struggle, leading to whipsaw losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- High Turnover: These strategies often require frequent trading, which can lead to higher transaction costs and tax implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Risk of Herding: Momentum strategies can contribute to market bubbles as many traders chase the same trends, leading to instability when trends reverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lagging Indicators: Momentum indicators may lag in signaling the reversal of trends, causing late entry or exit points that reduce potential profits.\n",
